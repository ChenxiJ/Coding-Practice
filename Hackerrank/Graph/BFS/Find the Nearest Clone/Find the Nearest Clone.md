There is a connected undirected graph where each of the nodes is a color. Given a color, find the shortest path connecting any two nodes of that color. Each edge has a weight of 1. 
If there is not a pair or if the color is not found, print -1. 

*ids*: an array of integers, the color id per node. </br> 
*val*: an integer, the id of the color to match.
