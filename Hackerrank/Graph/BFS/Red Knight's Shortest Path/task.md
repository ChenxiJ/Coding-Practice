The red knight can move to six different positions based on its current position (UpperLeft, UpperRight, Right, LowerRight, LowerLeft, Left).

Given the coordinates of the starting position of the red knight and the coordinates of the destination, print the minimum number of moves that the red knight has to make in order to reach the destination and after that, print the order of the moves that must be followed to reach the destination in the shortest way. If the destination cannot be reached, print only the word "Impossible".

Note: There may be multiple shortest paths leading to the destination. Hence, assume that the red knight considers its possible neighbor locations in the following order of priority: UL, UR, R, LR, LL, L. In other words, if there are multiple possible options, the red knight prioritizes the first move in this list, as long as the shortest path is still achievable.
