Hackerland is a one-dimensional city with houses aligned at integral locations along a road. Given an array of integers representing the locatoin
of the houses (unsorted). Now we want to install radio transmitters on the roofs of the city's houses. Each transmitter has a fixed range *k* meaning it can transmit a 
signal to all houses within *k* of units distance away. Find the minimum number of transmitters needed to cover all of the houses.
