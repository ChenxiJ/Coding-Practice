Goodland is a country with a number of evenly spaced cities along a line. The distance between adjacent cities is 1 unit. 
The government wants to provide electricity to all the cities with fewest number of pylons. 
Given an array with 0 and 1, where 1 are the cities can have pylons, and a distribution range of *k*, find the lowest number 
of plants that must be built such that all cities are served. The distribution range limits supply to cities where distance is less than k.
If it cannot be done, return -1.
