Given the share price of some stock for the next number of days.

Each day, you can either buy one share, sell any number of shares that you own, or not make any transaction at all.
Find the maximum profit you can obtain with an optimum trading strategy.

For example, if you know that prices for the next two days are [1, 2], you should buy one share day one, and sell it day two for a profit of 1. 
If they are instead [2, 1], no profit can be made so you don't buy or sell stock those days.
