A gene is represented as a string of length *n* (where *n* is divisible by 4), composed of the letters A, C, G, and T. 
It is considered to be steady if each of the four letters occurs exactly *n*/4 times. Given a string *gene*, not necessarily steady,
find the length of the minimum length substring that can be replaced to make *gene* stable.

Note: A substring of a string *s* is a subsequence made up of zero or more contiguous characters of *s*.
