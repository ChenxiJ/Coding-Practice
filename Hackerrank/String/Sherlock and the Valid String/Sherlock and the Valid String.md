A string is *valid* if all characters of the string appear the same number of times. 
It is also *valid* if can remove just 1 character at 1 index in the string, and the remaining characters
will occur the same number of times. 

Given a string *s* (all lower case characters), determine if it is *valid*. If so, return YES, otherwise return NO.
