# Finding the common subsequence by backtracking exactly how the dp is built. From the last entry of dp, if row and column equals,
# then this value comes from its upper left cell + 1; if not, this value is from the bigger one of either its left or upper cell.
# Stick to one direction, for example left, then only when its upper cell is GREATER than its left cell, move up (if equal, move left), 
# otherwise move left.

# about dp initialization, putting extra row and column of 0 before the real matrix extremely helpful!!
