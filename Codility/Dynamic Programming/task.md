For a given set of values, you are asked to find the minimum number of coins with
which a given amount of money can be paid. Assume that you can use as many coins of
a particular value as necessary.

For instance, for an amount of 6 and coins of values 1, 3, 4, the optimal solution here is 6 = 3 + 3.
