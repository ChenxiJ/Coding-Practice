Given an array of events where events[i] = [startDayi, endDayi]. Every event i starts at startDayi and ends at endDayi.

You can attend an event i at any day d where startTimei <= d <= endTimei. Notice that you can only attend one event at any time d.

Return the maximum number of events you can attend.


Example 2:

- Input: events= [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,2]]
- Output: 4
